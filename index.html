  <h1> Tutorial</h1>
  
  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p>Our tool is designed to help screen reader users and others who use keyboard navigation to access 
  the internet conduct accessibility audits of websites. Many features of websites are inaccessible to 
  blind and low-vision users, and our auditing tool is designed to make the process of reporting these 
  problems as convenient and accessible as possible. </p>
  
  <h2> How to Report a Usability or Accessibility Problem </h2>
  <p>When browsing a website using a keyboard or screen reader, individual page elements are targeted
  with focus. When you are targeting an inaccessible feature of the page with your focus, press [f13]
  to add an annotation about that element to your report. You can use voice or keyboard input to create
  this annotation, which can be written in plain language or in technical terms such as a specific 
  WCAG violation. It’s your choice! </p>
  
  <h2> Reporting Practice: An Inaccessible Image </h2>
  <p>Let’s get some practice reporting an inaccessible element. The image below this paragraph is
  inaccessible because of a lack of descriptive text. Use your keyboard to navigate the focus to
  the image, then report it by pressing [f13]. </p>
  
  <img alt="This image has no descriptive text. Report this problem by pressing F13"/>
  <h2> Exporting Your Report </h2>
  <p> When you are ready to export a summary of the problems you found, press [F14] to begin exporting a report.
  The program automatically annotates the website code with the issues you have uncovered and produces
  a list of accessibility problems that can be used to improve the website.</p>
  
  <p> We have discovered one accessibility error on this page already: the unlabeled image. Press [F14] to produce a report. </p>
  
  <h2>Learning More About Accessibility Standards</h2>
  <p> While your experiences browsing a site are valuable and important to report, there are also formalized standards
  such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) that codify expectations about website features.
  To learn more about these guidelines, click here to review the official WCAG documentation.</p>
